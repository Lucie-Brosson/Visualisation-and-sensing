# Visualisation and sensing
 Year 2 semestre 2 - Visualisation and sensing class
 
 The main project is in the final assessement. This project is about the relationship we create with objects. I used Three js and Cannon es to make this project. You can find the project website [here](https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~lbrosson/Final%20assessment/Personal_object_version_9.html)

go to the wiki to have more informations on the project.

In the formative assessement folder you will find the first design iteration of my project. You can find the web page [here](https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~lbrosson/Visualisation-and-sensing/formative%20assessment/Link_to_me.html)
