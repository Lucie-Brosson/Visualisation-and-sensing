# Visualisation and sensing
 Year 2 semestre 2 - Visualisation and sensing class
 
 The main project is in the final assessement. This project is about the relationship we create with objects. I used Three js and Cannon es to make this project. 
go to the wiki to have more informations on the project.

In the formative assessement folder you will find the first design iteration of my project. You can find the web page [here](https://lucie-brosson.github.io/Visual_and_sensing/Personal_object_version_9.html)
